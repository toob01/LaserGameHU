CleanGUI is an abstract GUI-library

Its key benefits are:
+ Display independence: you can change display without changing your app code (*).
+ Multi-task display sharing: multiple tasks can send commands to the display without disrupting eachother.
+ Modern gui-hierarchy. Easy to keep overview of.
+ Support for touchscreens.

CleanGUI does not natively support a specific display.
It can be connected to existing display drivers via a
DisplayAdapter class.

For example, the library CleanGUI_ext_for_TFT_eSPI implements
such a DisplayAdapter for the existing display driver TFT_eSPI.

In the examples folder of CleanGUI_ext_for_TFT_eSPI, you can
find all examples for CleanGUI.
